## 7. Business Logic & Rules

### 7.1 Inventory Management Rules
- Stock quantities must be non-negative integers
- Sales cannot exceed available inventory for tracked products  
- Custom products (non-inventory) use UUID-based IDs with "custom-" prefix
- Stock updates are atomic within database transactions
- Low stock threshold is configurable (default: 5 units)

- Customer names are required, contact and address are optional
- Duplicate customers are identified by name + contact combination
- Customer creation is automatic during sales process
- Customer information is stored as snapshot within each sale

### 7.3 Sales Processing Rules
- All monetary values are stored as decimal numbers for accuracy
- Sales require at least one item and valid customer information
- Line totals are calculated as quantity × unit price
- Subtotal is sum of all line totals
- Total equals subtotal (tax features not currently implemented)
- Sales are immutable once created (editing requires special handling)

### 7.4 Data Integrity Rules
- All database operations use transactions for atomicity
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Automatic timestamp tracking for audit trails
- Soft deletion preferred over hard deletion where relationships exist
